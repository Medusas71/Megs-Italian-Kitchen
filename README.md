# Description  

I am currently studying the Full Stack Development Course through Code Institute. Part of the course I am required 
to complete 4 milestone projects. Meg's Italian Kitchen is my 3rd milestone project which is part of the Python and Data Centric Development.  

Meg's Italian Kitchen has been created for all lovers of Italian food.  
The purpose of this website is to have a variety of Italian recipes display so people can create mouth watering meals. 
The website will also accommodate for users that would like to add new recipes and amend and delete their own recipes when needed.
